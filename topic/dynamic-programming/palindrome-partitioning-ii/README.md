# Palindrome Partitioning II

## 🚀 Problem  
Given a string `s`, partition `s` such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome.
Return the minimum cuts needed for a palindrome partitioning of `s`.

## 📝 Examples  

### Example 1
```
Input: s = "aab
Output: 1
Explanation: The palindrome partitioning ["aa", "b"] could be produced using 1 cut.
```

### Example 2
```
Input: s = "a"
Output: 0
```

## ⚡ Constraints
- `1 <= s.length <= 2000`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters only.
