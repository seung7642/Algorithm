# Recover Binary Search Tree

## 🚀 Problem  
You are given the `root` of a binary search tree (BST), where the values of exactly two nodes of the tree were swapped by mistake. Recover the tree without changing its structure.

## 📝 Examples  

### Example 1
```
Input: root = [1,3,null,null,2]
Output: [3,1,null,null,2]
Explanation: 3 cannot be a left child of 1 because 3 > 1. Swapping 1 and 3 makes the BST valid.
```


## ⚡ Constraints  
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 1000]`
- `-2^31 <= Node.val <= 2^31 - 1`
