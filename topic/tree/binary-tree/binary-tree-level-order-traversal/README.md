# Binary Tree Level Order Traversal

## 🚀 Problem  
Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level).

## 📝 Examples  

### Example 1

```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[3],[9,20],[15,7]]
```

### Example 2

```
Input: root = []1
Output: [[1]]
```

## ⚡ Constraints  
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 2000]`
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`
