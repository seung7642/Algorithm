# Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal

## 🚀 Problem  
Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).

## 📝 Examples  

### Example 1
```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[3],[20,9],[15,7]]
```


## ⚡ Constraints  
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[10, 2000]`
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
